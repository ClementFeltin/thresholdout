This is a copy of Dwork et al's supplementary code for the paper *[The reusable holdout: Preserving validity in adaptive data analysis](https://www.sciencemag.org/content/349/6248/636.short)*. It was originally hosted [here](https://www.sciencemag.org/content/suppl/2015/08/05/349.6248.636.DC1/aaa9375_SupportingFile_Other_seq5_v1.py).

I've also written [a short blogpost](http://andyljones.tumblr.com/post/127547085623/holdout-reuse) on the ideas involved.

Disclaimer: I have nothing to do with this Dwork et al or this research. I've hosted it here simply because it gives
the code syntax highlighting and I can't find a copy anywhere else.
